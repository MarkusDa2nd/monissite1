  <p>A proofreader is a valuable asset in the publishing world. Before a magazine
    or newspaper goes to print, there is the process of editing and proofreading
    that must occur. Pages must be checked for correct spelling and grammar; margins
    and spacing must be adjusted so the articles flow smoothly; and pictures must be
    placed within the articles for the flow to seem consistent. Proofreaders are often
    responsible for all of these important pieces; they are the people who make publications
    look their very best.
